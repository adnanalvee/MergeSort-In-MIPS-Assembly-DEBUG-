# MergeSort-In-MIPS-Assembly-DEBUG-

Computer Architecure Project:
A merge sort Algorithm implemented in MIPS. Users can enter integers upto 32 digits and taking multiples of 2 as input; 
algorthim starts merging by diving the list and merging them and keeps doing so until the input has been merged 
in increasing order.

Code is in DEBUG version, lots of extra registers used :P
